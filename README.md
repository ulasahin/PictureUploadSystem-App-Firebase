# PictureUploadWebService-Firebase

This project allows the user to store a photo or video to Google Cloud's Firebase Storage service. Every user who enters the site stores their files in a public folder.

The concept of the site is designed for weddings and is suitable for mobile devices. That's why its design was made accordingly. (The site has no restrictions on uploading photos or videos as file types; any type of file can be uploaded.)

## Technologies Used
- Angular, Node.js, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Media Queries(For mobile device compatibility.), Google Cloud Firebase Storage.


**A version of this site was developed using Java Spring Boot, without using Firebase. ([see](https://github.com/ulasahin/PictureUploadWebSite))**
